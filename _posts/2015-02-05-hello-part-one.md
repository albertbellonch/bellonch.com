####So it has been a while since I don't have a proper blog, and I thought it might be nice to have a platform for that.

And it truly has been a long while.

Back in April of 2009, I already decided to embark in this frightening,
expected-to-be-awesome experience called Erasmus. At first I only
thought of going away for a semester, but then I was convinced that the
best began after being some months there, so I dove in head first. In
fact, I ended up requesting a year-and-a-half Erasmus stay in Turin, northern
Italy, which would get me a double degree in Computer Science Engineering for
both countries.

In order to log my experiences to come, I launched a blog called
[Enaldi](https://enaldi.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}.
Still months before saying goodbye to my life in my hometown
([Palau-solit√† i Plegamans](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Palau-solit%C3%A0+i+Plegamans,+Barcelona/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x12a4c0665e83c7dd:0xea1542a1454bac58?sa=X&ei=RNLMVInqGYbuUuurgJgG&ved=0CCAQ8gEwAA){:target="_blank"},
near Barcelona),
I was already using it for unrelated purposes: a few tech posts and walkthroughs, quotes from
historical or current figures that I respected, talking about random
stuff or even
[unboxing my first iPhone](https://enaldi.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/iphone-unpacking/){:target="_blank"}.

When the moment came, on September of that year, I said goodbye to my
family and friends, got into a Ryanair plane to Turin, and began a new
life. Scary? Of course. Specially in the beginning. But also awesome.
Living in a city for the first time, meeting people from a
thousand different places, and going to lectures (and even doing exams)
in a language I only practiced for a month before turned out to be a
spectacular experience.

I still blogged, though! I talked about several topics on the city:
public transport, how the paperwork and bureaucracy are similarly painful to Spain,
my experience of such a drastic change in my life, or even a small trip
I did with some friends to Florence and some cities nearby.

Also publishing about the topics I treated before going to Turin, the
writing frequence went down as I was getting through that wonderful year
in one of the most beautiful cities in Italy. Then summer began, only to
allow me a nice but short period of relax in my hometown before preparing
everything that I needed for my next journey: writing the thesis in London.

Next chapter soon!
