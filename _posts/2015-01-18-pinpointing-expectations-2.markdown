#### In my work as a front-end developer, I’ve come to realize that expectations, and how you handle them, are one of the most integral parts of a project. Expectations are tricky things, especially because we don’t talk about them very much.

Somehow, we always expect other people to just know what we’re thinking. Expectations have a tendency to shift and change, too. Sometimes during the course of a project, as you learn, research, and work, expectations change because of new knowledge gained while working. Other times an outside influence changes, say a competitor comes out with a new feature or product, which could cause the goals and expectations of your project to change as well. 

Not talking about expectations causes a lot of headaches throughout a project. We aren’t mind readers, but clients and colleagues often expect us to be. Even when expectations aren’t articulated, there’s often frustration when you don’t meet them. This is why showing your work as often as possible and talking about it as you go can be a helpful way to make sure things are living up to expectations.

So how do we handle this? We have to try as hard as we can to draw out the expectations at the beginning, learning what’s expected so that we can be prepared to meet those goals. We also have to check in throughout the project to see if things have changed.

Recently, I was on a project that ran over by several months, dragging on longer than I and, I think, the client expected. I was getting a bit antsy. When would we wrap up? What was going on?

As a freelancer, my schedule is important and things that throw it out of whack are hard on me. Sticking up for myself isn’t always easy, but the client’s schedule changed over the course of the project and it was my job to figure out how to make the project end successfully. I did the email thing, I asked all the questions, and frankly, I pushed a bit. After several emails, and some explanations on both sides, things were sorted out in a way that worked for everyone.

This wasn’t a huge issue, but it could have grown larger if not acknowledged, talked about, and handled. Often it’s the small issues that can snowball into bigger ones down the road, so handling them early on saves everyone a lot of grief. Below, I go into more detail on how to get a handle on expectations early so issues either don’t come up, or they don’t blow up into something unmanageable.

##Managing expectations

At the beginning of the project I ask for a detailed scope. The goal of this is to have everyone spell out what the end of the project looks like. When I’m done with my work, what will that work look like, what will the final project consist of? Ultimately, what is my deliverable?

- What is the goal of the project?
- What do you hope I’ll have done at the end?
- How will we know it’s done?
- How often will we meet to discuss the project when it’s in process?
- Do you have a workflow you prefer for projects?
- Are there milestones along the way, midpoints in the project and what are they?
- What is the design process and how does the development team fit into that?
- How finalized do designs need to be before starting to work in code?
- Do you iterate and do designing in code or not?
